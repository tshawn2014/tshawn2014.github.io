								Actually, there are several reasons why I start my own blog. First, having one's own blog is super cool!!! I can share knowledge with others via this channel. To some extent, it is a kind of proof of experience. Second, I regard this blog as my motivation to learn more things. I believe most of you who are reading this passage have learned things from other's blogs. I hope one day I can be such a helpful blog writer. With this motivation, maybe I can get rid of my torpor. Moreover, I can write down some interesting ideas here so that I will not forget them. <font color = "red">For example, currently, I am new to github and MacOS teminal, so I want to create a cheet sheet to promote my working efficiency.</font>

								You can follow my Twitter, Facebook or Instagram to communicate with my and share opinions with me.
